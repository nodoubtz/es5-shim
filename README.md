## Introduction

The ES5 Shim project provides compatibility shims so that legacy JavaScript engines behave as closely as possible to ECMAScript 5 (ES5). This allows developers to use ES5 features in environments that do not natively support them, enabling a more consistent and modern JavaScript development experience.

## Installation

You can install ES5 Shim via npm, yarn, or by including it directly in your HTML.

### NPM

```sh
npm install es5-shim
